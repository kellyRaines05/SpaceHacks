A 20 hour hackathon which explored the tracking of water resources in Nepal. The satellite data used within this project comes from the GRACE and GLDAS satellite data. Tracking of water resources are calculated using the following: GWa = TWSa - SWa - SMa - SWEa where<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GWa is the Ground Water Storage Anomaly indicates the change in ground water storage over time,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TWSa is the Total Water Storage Anomaly in which GRACE tracks the water thickness of water being stored in Nepal using gravity over time,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SWa is the Surface Water Anomaly which collects data about the changes in the amount of water available in open reservoirs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMa is the Soil Moisture Anomaly in which GLDAS tracks the change in soil moisture, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SWEa is the Snow Water Equivalent Anomaly which captures the change in water due to snow and snow melt. <br>
